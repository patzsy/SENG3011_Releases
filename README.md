Perl script testing instruction:
Run the script with the output csv file as the first argument and the input csv file as the second argument, as an example:
“perl test.pl output.csv input.csv” (output.csv is generated from executing the module with the input.csv)
If the test fails it will print all the case where it fails together will all the necessary information like time and compared value, otherwise it will simply print “test success”.
